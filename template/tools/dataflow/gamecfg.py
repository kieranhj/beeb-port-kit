"""gamecfg -- what the dataflow tools need to know about the game being analysed.

The tools are the engine's (beebgame/tools/dataflow); each game says what is its own in a
config file, a Python module of assignments, passed as --config (or the environment's
DATAFLOW_CONFIG).  Anything it leaves out keeps the default below: a game with none of
these features (no inline-operand helpers, no object model) needs no config at all.

    GAME_DIR          the game's sources, relative to the game's root ('src')
    ISR_ROOTS         the interrupt's entry labels (the engine's, by default)
    ISR_DATA_POINTERS pointers the interrupt reads its own data through (never the game's
                      variables); names match ignoring case and underscores
    INLINE_HELPERS    {label: (roles, uses)}: subroutines whose operands follow the JSR
                      inline, so no code analysis can follow their returns; their contract.
                      roles per operand byte: 'rw16' / 'w16' / 'r16' a zero-page word read
                      and written / written / read, 'i' an immediate byte; uses: the
                      registers read on entry ('A', 'X', 'Y').  X and Y are preserved; A N Z
                      C V are clobbered
    HELPER_SCRATCH    the helpers' own zero-page words (written by every one)
    HELPER_CARRY_X0   label prefixes of helpers that return C = bit 0 of the caller's X
    SCREEN_POINTERS   zero-page pointers the game writes the screen through (stores through
                      them are taken never to hit a variable)
    VAR_SEGMENTS      the game's variable segments (patterns.py's const_var looks there)
    LOADER_DBG        the load-time program's debug file in the build directory, analysed
                      too when the object model's records are built there (None: not)
    OBJECTS           None, or the object model (ranges.py: records summarised per type):
        records       the label of the record array
        count         the label of its record count (an equate) or a number
        stride        bytes a record
        type_field    the label of the type field's offset (an equate)
        fields        the field-offset labels, for the summary's table
        types         the type values the levels use
        type_prefix   the prefix of the type equates' names (for display)
        current       the zero-page pointer to the record being processed (its type is
                      the key of the per-type values)
        type_var      the zero-page byte the loader keeps the record's type in
        loader_file   the source file of the loader's record builder (its stores through
                      `current` build the records; its other stores into them are its clear)
        bind          a regex of the loader's store that binds the record's type
